Strange, isn't it?#$e#Embrace the mysteries of the day, @.${{e9}}",
				"summer_Wed4": "Some may say I'm a master manipulator. I usually don't have to charm my way out of things if it's a guy I'm dealing with. I just fondle my breats a little and it works like magic!${{e1}}",

But this is just a theory of mine, nothing concrete about it.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.${{e1}}",

				"summer_Tue8": "The problem with monsters is that most of the time they do not know why they do what they are doing.#$b#Some are created, or others are enchanted in some terrible way.

Learn something new.${{e1}}",
				"summer_Thu8": "In youth, my powers were attuned for fighting, and I could hold my own. It was a heart-pounding time.${{e3}}#$b#Unfortunately, it cost me some years of my life. I have little to show for it other than the scars.#$e#Seek the energies, @. Enjoy the day.${{e7}}",
				"summer_Fri8": "The mines go deeper than you might imagine, and there are secrets locked away that will probably never be found.${{e3}}#$b#It is my hope that all the horrible things that happened down there stay there, and sometimes I must interfere.${{e2}}#$e#Focus your mind today, @, and be at peace.${{e7}}",

Thank you for choosing me, @.${{e7}}#$e#You are what holds me to this reality.${{e1}}",
